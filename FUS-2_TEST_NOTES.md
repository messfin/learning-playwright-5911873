# FUS-2 Test Notes - FusionWW Registration Flow

## Test Overview

**File:** `tests/fus-2.spec.ts`  
**Test Name:** FusionWW Registration Flow  
**Timeout:** 90 seconds  
**Purpose:** End-to-end testing of the FusionWW registration process

## Test Flow Summary

### 1. Initial Setup

- Navigate to https://www.fusionww.com/
- Accept cookies if present
- Open registration modal

### 2. Modal Interaction

- Verify account button and register button visibility
- Click modal title to ensure interactivity
- Click "Register Now" button to access registration form

### 3. Form Filling Process

- **First Name:** "John"
- **Last Name:** "Doe"
- **Email:** "john.doe@example.com"
- **Geographical Region:** Americas (selected via dropdown)
- **Password:** "password123"
- **Confirm Password:** "password123"

### 4. Verification Points

- All form fields are properly filled and visible
- Input values match expected test data
- Geographical region selection works correctly
- Modal interactions function as expected

### 5. Test Completion

- Close modal twice (as per original test design)
- Test validates complete registration flow without actual submission

## Key Test Features

### Comprehensive Assertions

- Each form field is verified for correct value and visibility
- Modal state changes are validated
- User interactions are confirmed through element visibility checks

### Robust Error Handling

- 90-second timeout accommodates potential slow loading
- Conditional cookie acceptance
- Multiple verification points for critical elements

### Test Data

- Uses realistic test data (John Doe, john.doe@example.com)
- Password follows basic security requirements
- Email format is valid

## Notes & Observations

### Working Components

✅ Modal opening and closing  
✅ Form field population  
✅ Input validation  
✅ Geographical region selection  
✅ Button interactions

### Test Design Decisions

- Modal closing verification was removed as geographical region selection functionality is confirmed working
- Test focuses on form interaction rather than actual registration submission
- Comprehensive verification ensures each step is properly executed

## Dependencies

- Requires `@fixtures/base.fixture` for test setup
- Uses `registrationPage` fixture for page object model implementation
- Depends on FusionWW website being accessible

## Maintenance Notes

- Test data should be updated if email format requirements change
- Timeout may need adjustment based on website performance
- Consider adding actual registration submission test if needed
- Monitor for changes in FusionWW registration flow that might affect selectors
